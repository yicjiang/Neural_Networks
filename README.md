1. BLUE BIKE TRIP DURATION PREDICTION: received some data from Blue Bikes (the Boston Bikesharing Service). They have asked you to provide a predictive model that can accurately predict how  long a given bike rental will last, at the time the rental begins. The use case is that the bike share company wants to be able to predict how long a customer will have the bike in their possession, when they begin their rental, in order to better manage operational efficiency across the bike network.
